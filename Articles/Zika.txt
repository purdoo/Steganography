Use a Condom to Avoid Zika, CDC Tells Travelers
Men who have traveled to Zika-affected zones should use a condom if they want to be absolutely sure they don't infect sex partners, federal health officials advised Friday. And men with a pregnant sex partner who have been to Zika-affected zones should just use a condom or abstain from sex until the baby is born, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Health officials in Dallas said this week they had confirmed a case of sexual transmission in which one person traveled to Venezuela, where Zika is spreading, and come back to Dallas to infect a sex partner. "Men with a pregnant sex partner who reside in or have traveled to an area of active Zika virus transmission and their pregnant sex partners should consistently and correctly use condoms during sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) or abstain from sexual activity for the duration of the pregnancy," the CDC said in its latest advisory on Zika. "Our priority here is to prevent a pregnant woman from becoming infected with Zika," CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden told reporters. "The bottom line for most people in the U.S. is that pregnant women should postpone travel to Zika-affected areas. Our new guidance is that pregnant women should use condoms during sex or abstain if their partner has traveled to an area where Zika has been spreading." Frieden said no one knows what would happen if a pregnant woman was exposed to Zika virus through sex, so it's not worth taking the chance.
